# Advanced GPU Benchmark Suite

This is a comprehensive suite of benchmarks to evaluate the performance of GPUs across various workloads, including tensor operations, memory bandwidth, rendering, latency, power consumption, and zero-knowledge (ZK) algorithm performance.

## Features

- **Tensor Operations Benchmark**: Measures the throughput (in GFLOPS) of GPU tensor operations such as element-wise vector addition.
- **Memory Bandwidth Benchmark**: Measures the GPU's memory transfer speed (in GB/s) for large data sets.
- **Rendering Benchmark**: Simulates a simple 3D rendering workload and measures the achieved frame rate (in FPS).
- **Latency Benchmark**: Measures the average latency (in microseconds) of executing individual GPU kernel operations.
- **Power Consumption Benchmark**: Measures the average power draw (in watts) of the GPU under sustained load.
- **ZK Proof Benchmark**: Measures the performance (in milliseconds) of the GPU in generating zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs.

## Installation

1. Create a new Conda environment using the provided `gpu-benchmark-environment.yml` file:

   ```
   conda env create -f gpu-benchmark-environment.yml
   ```

2. Activate the environment:

   ```
   conda activate gpu-benchmark
   ```

3. Alternatively, you can install the Python dependencies directly using the `gpu-benchmark-requirements.txt` file:

   ```
   pip install -r gpu-benchmark-requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the full suite of benchmarks, execute the `advanced-gpu-benchmark.py` script:

```
python advanced-gpu-benchmark.py
```

This will output the results for each individual benchmark, including the measured performance metrics.
